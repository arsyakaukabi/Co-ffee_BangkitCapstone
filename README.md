Starting from the story by one of our bangkit team members from Aceh Muhammad Naufal Ariiq, who said that coffee business stakeholders in his area had difficulty identifying the moisture levels in green coffee beans quickly and accurately, besides that there were difficulties by the farmers in identifying diseases that existed in coffee plants and lack of insight in handling and preventing Disease. 

Our project is based on a problem that happens in one of the highest valued commodities in Indonesia, and that is coffee. By solving the problems, the commodity quantity and quality will be increased. And finally the economy in our society will be increased as well.
